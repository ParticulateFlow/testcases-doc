##### Abstract

**Shrinkage of a particle due to chemical reaction kinetics.**

With the use of the Shrinking Particle Model (SPM), in which the particle reacts with the reacting fluid without forming an ash layer behind (Fig. left), the communication framework is tested between the CFD and DEM sides for chemical reactions. In the test case, a single particle reacts with the reactant gas and shrinks according to a user defined reaction rate coefficient (k). The particle is removed from the domain after it reaches the minimum radius value, which is either given by the user or calculated from the Hertzian time step for multiple particles. The case is verified by comparing the rate of change of masses. The graph below demonstrates the rate of change of mass for the reactant gas species O<sub>2</sub> and for the product species CO<sub>2</sub> for the given case.

##### Known Limitations

* This case has been formulated in order to test the communication framework for chemical reactions.
* Only up to 355 particles were tested - max available particles without overlap in current domain.
